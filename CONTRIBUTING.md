## üñäÔ∏è **Code Style Guidelines**

Maintaining a consistent code style helps us keep the codebase clean and readable. We use the following guidelines:

1. **Follow Rust‚Äôs best practices**: Stick to idiomatic Rust where applicable. You can use tools like `rustfmt` to format your code and `clippy` for linting.
2. **Use clear variable names**: Variable and function names should clearly express their purpose.
3. **Keep code modular**: Break larger functionalities into smaller, reusable functions and modules.
4. **Write comments where necessary**: Especially for complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

Make sure to run formatting tools before submitting a PR to avoid unnecessary style-related reviews.

## üß™ **Testing and Documentation**

### Writing Tests
Testing is crucial to maintain the integrity of our tools. Ensure that any new features or bug fixes are well-tested. 
- Unit tests should cover a variety of edge cases.
- Make sure existing tests pass after your changes.
- Add integration tests for significant changes that affect multiple components.

### Documentation
Clear documentation is essential for users and future contributors to understand your code.
- If you introduce a new feature, update the relevant documentation.
- Add code comments to explain complex logic.
- Check for typos or unclear sentences in existing docs and correct them.
